This is a simple X11 utility that disables a tablet's touchscreen when the
digitizer is near.

It requires the XInput extension and its accompanying library. On Debian, this
is available in the package libxi-dev.

It's been developed and tested on a ThinkPad Yoga (first generation), which
is what the input device names are configured for.

A future revision will support naming devices via command line options, but
for the time being they are compiled in. If you are using a different tablet,
you may need to edit the values of PENDEVICE and/or TOUCHDEVICE in
penxortouch.c. Hopefully these names are self-explanatory. The command
xinput(1) will give you a list of the input devices available on your system.

A future revision will also include a genuine man page. As it is, there are
no run-time options. Simply run the program, penxortouch, and it will disable
the touchscreen device whenever the pen device comes in proximity to the
screen, and reenable the touchscreen when the pen leaves proximity.
